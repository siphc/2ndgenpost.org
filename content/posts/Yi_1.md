No one can remain calm under the bullets and lies of imperialism.

Tuesday, October seventeenth, night. After suffering through nine days of continuous air strikes, bombings, and annihilation by the imperialist Israeli government, Gaza, still locked down, has been razed to the ground. Palestinians, trapped in the Gaza strip and denied of water and electricity by the militarist Israeli government, sought shelter in the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in northern Gaza. Medical staff, patients, the wounded and displaced, along with their families, supported by the only functioning generator in the hospital, tried their best to simply remain alive.

That night, many of them perished.

That night, many of them had just arrived in this world.

Not long after, the remaining, filled with despair and desperately trying to save the remains of their loved ones from the rubble, were hit by another missile with perfect precision. They succumbed too.

Four days earlier, on October 13, Israeli military demanded 1.1 million Palestinians who live north of the Wadi Gaza, including the entirety of Gaza city, to evacuate to the south within 24 hours. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced out of their homes, banished into the desert, into an even more cramped and suffocating area. Loathed, discarded, and butchered by imperialist colonizers, they’re not unlike discarded items, used up relics, or overworked livestock.

At the same time, the imperialist elites, with their hand-crafted “humanitarians” and outstanding citizens, once again put lies into people’s mouths. Practicing colonial governing tactics, they perform the benevolence of “we don’t target civilians”, while covering, committing genocide against Palestinians in the name of the Israeli people.

They are the lucky survivors of Nazi concentration camps no longer; they are the armed guards of the open-air Gaza death camp, swift and ruthless to cut supplies off or pull the trigger on those so-called Palestinian “humanoids”. They are executing a malicious plan to turn Gaza into a “no-man’s land”, and to establish a pure “Jewish state” on the “empty” soil.

They are the spiritual descendants of colonists who attempted to establish a pure “white man’s country” on the colored soils of America, Australia, and Africa. They condemn other Jews who disagree with them for not adhering to this pure ideal. They label those who voice for the suffering of the Palestinian people as antisemites, trying to ostracize them from society, just like the way they did with the Palestinians. To them, this represents the finest “humanitarianism”, while in reality they have put on everyone the shackles of racial supremacism.

Colonizers will always assert that the violence demanded by imperialism is moderate, reasonable, and humane, while the violence of the oppressed is to be labelled foolish. “Do you condemn the atrocities committed by Hamas?” is like an imperialist curse, censuring anyone who attempts to voice their view on this question. In a world woven by such imperialists, questions like these have only one answer.

Colonizers constantly try to create obedient victims, constantly try to sculpt resistance into irrational craze. The articulation of non-violence movements and the symbolic praise of sovereign rule hatched a sense of hallucination among many, as if slavery and colonialism have magically disappeared from this world with the civil rights movements of the 20th century. It is hard to believe that even in modern day, there are still people in the world – perhaps constituting a majority – living under the threats of invasion by an imperialist power, even after attaining symbolic “freedom”. Throughout the past half century, imperialists package such “freedom” and actual inequality together into an illusion of governance and development.

>  growth of the Israeli economy for 13 years… indicates abnormal tenacity… growth rate exceeds nearly all other OECD countries… Employment rate maintains rapid growth every year, as unemployment rate continues to drop… financial measures enacted in 2003 guaranteed sustained downward trend for public debt… tax burden is also lower than the average for OECD countries… ample capital and profits for the banking system… Israel’s high-tech enterprises are also thriving…”

The above passage is from the 2016 annual report about the Israeli economy, published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Within lies many familiar financial legends about the Israeli economy: rapid growth, thriving, high-tech… Indeed, who would not admire such marvelous achievements? However, the report also mentioned that one of the weaknesses in Israel's economic development is that its economic policies are not friendly to "inclusive growth". The euphemistic language reflects a harsh reality: opportunities from economic growth are not equal for everyone, and the macro benefits of economic growth are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a very few.

The "economic myth" story of Israel began in 1985. In 1984, Shimon Peres was elected as the Prime Minister of Israel. This member of the Haganah (precursor to the Israel Defense Forces) had been working in the defense sector ever since the establishment of the country in 1948. In 1974, Peres became the Defense Minister in the Rabin government. At that time, the Yom Kippur War of 1973 had only recently ended. After the war, Arab countries began joint actions to impose an oil embargo on Israel and its Western allies, directly leading to a surge in energy prices in Western markets. In the following decade, Israel experienced high inflation while having a sharp slowdown in economic growth.

In 1983, Israel faced a severe banking and stock market crisis, plummeting stock prices. To save the banking sector, Israel had no choice but to adopt a nationalization plan, spending a total of $6.9 billion to purchase bank stocks and help to temporarily overcome difficulties. At that time, Israel's annual GDP was merely $27 billion.

During this decade, the right-wing Likud party also formed and quickly became a core power in Israeli politics. In the 1977 elections, the newly established Likud party achieved a huge victory, pushing the long-standing ruling party, the Labour Party, off the stage and becoming the largest party in the Israeli parliament, forming a coalition government.

In fact, ever since the Six-Day War in 1967, right-wing forces had been steadily rising in Israeli politics. In the 1969 elections, the right-wing National Religious Party won 12 seats in a parliament dominated by left-wing parties. In the wake of the 1977 elections, the NRP and Likud formed a coalition, essentially establishing the current right-wing nationalistic and religious political structure of Israel. This political force represents the middle class of Israeli society, with the majority coming from the IDF, academia, and the rapidly rising business sector.

When Peres was elected, Israel's economy was in dire straits. During the first half year of 1984, Israel's annualized inflation rate had reached as high as 400%. By the second half, this figure had soared to a staggering 1000%, with massive capital outflows also rapidly depleting Israel's foreign exchange reserves. After Peres formed a coalition government with Likud, they quickly began to undertake economic reforms.
 
This plan, known as the "Economic Stabilization Plan," includes three main aspects: first, a significant reduction in the fiscal budget deficit, primarily achieved by cutting government food subsidies; second, a 20% devaluation of the Israeli currency; lastly, freezing all domestic currency-dominated operations, including wages, prices, and foreign exchange. At the same time, the Peres government, with the assistance of a U.S. economic advisory team, obtained a two-year emergency aid package of $750 million annually from the U.S. government.

Following this, Israel's economy began to grow rapidly. This growth, formed through privatization, quickly gave rise to several wealthy families in Israel. In addition to monopolies in finance, industry, and high-end services, a few giants monopolized the entire food industry chain in Israel after the 1985 reforms. In a study, this type of monopoly is referred to as a "farm to market" supply chain control. The decline of low-end industrial sectors domestically was replaced by the rapid growth of high-tech and financial industries driven by international capital, allowing these businesses to easily operate globally.

Furthermore, the situation in the labor market is not optimistic either. As the Israeli economy grew, the proportion of labor in national income continued to decline, sharply widening income inequality among workers. In the early stages of the 1980s reform, 80% of Israeli industrial workers were affiliated with the Histadrut (Israel's Federation of Trade Unions), but due to double blows from government administration and economic policies, this figure had rapidly decreased to below 20% by the 2010s.

Researchers today attribute this inequality to an economic ideology called "neoliberalism", based on policies such as reducing public sector fiscal expenditures, privatizing public services, currency liberalization, and tax cuts. By promoting global capital flow, encouraging the development of private capital, increasing employment rates, and social wealth income, it exacerbates inequality. The term "neo" seems to imply something unprecedented in human history. The problems it causes are unique to our era, but they are but illusions created by imperialist powers.

In fact, the rise of the right-wing in Israel in the 1960s was almost like a replica of the development of colonial societies under capitalism. As if descending from the sky, colonists arrived on the native soils belonging to indigenous peoples either through purchase or occupation, and established communities on these lands belonging only to themselves.

Initially, these colonizers used a cooperative production method almost socialist in nature to start their lives on unfamiliar lands, but as the colonial territory and population expanded, new social stratifications began to appear. Colonizers naturally began to replicate the socio-economic organizational structure of capitalism, rapidly giving away the utopian ideal to the efficient capitalist hierarchy.

In this hierarchical structure, the economic prosperity of some relies on the impoverishment of others. This process of inevitable accumulation of impoverishment in the early stages of capitalist development is more like internal exploitation, leading to severe social inequality. In this context, expansion is not only about finding external markets but more about seizing more land and resources, seeking outlets for the local population and economic pressures, using the expansion of profits to temporarily alleviate the enormous dissatisfaction from local labor forces caused by inequality.

Just as Lenin mentioned in “Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism”, the causes for imperialist states are always inseparable from their imperial expansions. Granting independence to colonies and making them submit are both just opportunistic choices of different times by the bourgeoisie. Lenin noted in his work the following:

> “Cecil Rhodes, we are informed by his intimate friend, the journalist Stead, expressed his imperialist views to him in 1895 in the following terms: “I was in the East End of London (a working-class quarter) yesterday and attended a meeting of the unemployed. I listened to the wild speeches, which were just a cry for ‘bread! bread!’ and on my way home I pondered over the scene and I became more than ever convinced of the importance of imperialism.... My cherished idea is a solution for the social problem, i.e., in order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines. The Empire, as I have always said, is a bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you must become imperialists”.

Today, the right-wing government of Netanyahu in Israel holds no essential difference from Cecil Rhodes. They both place the survival of their own country above the thorough oppression of another group of people. After the neoliberal reforms in 1985, the Israeli government reopened peace talks with Palestine in the 1990s. One important outcome of this "peace" is to fully open the Palestinian market to Israel and completely absorb the Palestinian economy into Israel, becoming a subordinate.
 
In the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel, the economies of Arabs and Israelis are highly "integrated." Many Palestinians make a living in Israel, with the majority engaged in low-end labor. Like all global economic relationships under imperialism, Palestine is highly dependent on Israel economically. Approximately 40% of the Palestinian workforce earns a living in Israel, constituting a majority of the Palestinian economy. However, for Israel, Palestinian labor accounts for only around 6.5% of the total employment.

With the advent of Israel's neoliberal economic reforms, there arose a demand for labor, especially non-unionized cheap labor, providing an avenue for the population in the occupied Palestinian territories. In 1968, the per capita income in Palestine was only 10.2% of Israel's at that time. By 1986, this figure had increased to 22.8%. During relatively calm periods in Israeli-Palestinian relations, relying on this relationship, the Palestinian economy experienced an annual growth of about 5%. In the narrative of neoliberal economics, this is romanticized as a developmental "trickle-down" effect. However, whenever tensions between Israelis and Palestinians escalated, this economic growth model relying on Palestinians working in Israel immediately contracted.

However, the neoliberal economic narrative never addresses the short-term effects and the essence of the hegemonic nature of this global order system. Instead, they transform "development" into a universal narrative without social costs, erasing hierarchical differences. In reality, the so-called development is just one of the patterns that rely on hierarchical exploitation and a dependent structure. The political expression of this model is none other but imperialism and colonization.

Developments are never unfolded according to the expectations of imperialists. Starting from the 1980s, accompanying the imperialist governance came waves of Palestinian resistance (Intifada) one after another. For those at the bottom of this hegemonic structure, this dependency structurally turns the oppressed into tools that can be disposed of at will after use. Any display of violence or emotion is considered a disruption to the development of this hegemony, thus producing the "good” Palestinians under this imperialistic model. Meanwhile, one must not forget that this structure is not exclusive to "aliens": laborers under the Israeli imperialist government are also victims of oppression.

Just in January of this year (2023), the Israeli Federation of Trade Unions initiated a nationwide general strike, directly targeting the judicial reform proposals of the Netanyahu government. In the wake of protests, the Netanyahu government referred to the workers as "anarchists." The protests also revealed internal contradictions within the Israeli military. On March 25, after a massive gathering of 630,000 people, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant publicly expressed the hope of Netanyahu suspending the judicial reforms. He stated, "The intensifying social rift has penetrated into the military and security institutions." In response, Netanyahu dismissed Gallant.
 
However, the October 7 Hamas attacks temporarily masked this type of internal rifts within the Israeli militaristic government; under a unified military goal, Israel’s imperialism swiftly transformed into militarism. October 8, Israel established a wartime cabinet, which includes Gallant, who made remarks comparing Palestinians to “humanoids”, and called for a blockade to Gaza which cuts off its electrical and water supplies.

Today, the Israeli regime is undoubtably an outpost of the capitalist world elite, but it is also a time capsule of the colonial powers of the 19th century, oscillating between free trade and militarism. Like a brutal dictator, it uses imperialistic illusions and violence to extinguish liberation movements in order to preserve its own history. However, just as Sartre’s preamble for Fanon’s “The Wretched of the Earth” mentions, “such tactics can sometimes delay liberation, but it may never prevent liberation”.

December 1987. After yet another Palestinian uprising, Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani wrote:

> “The age of political rationality has long passed\
So, teach us to be crazy…”

This sense of hopeless resistance is the product of neoliberalism in a globalized world. To all oppressed people in this world, “There is no alternative”. This neoliberal proclamation is like a despairing curse, blocking all paths toward liberation and development. Not long before this era, after seeing the newly proclaimed People’s Republic of China, the Palestinian poet Abu Salma, forced into exile, wrote down such hopeful verses:

>	“We have gone through the same struggles,\
	We have experienced the same sufferings.\
	…\
	But now we are in Beijing,\
	We can spread our wings and soar.\
	The unyielding people here,\
	Have all blossomed their wings.\
	…\
	We band together and strive,\
	Glory belongs to us!\
	We shall have laurels on our heads,\
	Faces filled with joy.\
	…\
	When darkness obstructs the heavens,\
	The universe swirls fierce wind.\
	When Mao Zedong’s smile rise on the horizon,\
	Clear skies shower the earth!”

When the possibility appears anew in history, the resistance against tyranny will undoubtably be filled with hope once again.
