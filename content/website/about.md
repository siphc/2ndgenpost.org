**Who Are We?** 

2ndGenPost (2GP) is a nonprofit student-led news organization that reports world issues through a local lens. Our mission is to synthesize and translate news from different countries, addressing concerns about misrepresentations by "Western media." Bilingual or polyglot students volunteer to provide authentic foreign news in English. Our volunteers earn hours and work towards the President's Volunteer Service Award. Apart from promoting a more diverse perspective to international news, 2ndGenPost also aims to aid second generation immigrants or other immigrants in general who want to reconnect with their heritage countries but cannot speak the language by helping report the issues in their homelands in English. Committed to sustainability, our website runs on an eco-friendly host with a net-zero carbon footprint since our founding, and we operate entirely paper-free. Join us in empowering the next generation of informed and engaged global citizens.
